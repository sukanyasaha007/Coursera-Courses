Question
--------

Which of the following lists have a length of 3?  

### Answer

['a', 'b', 'c']  
[['a', 'b'], 'abc', []]  

### Explanation

The length of the list is the number of items in the list. Note that each item can itself be a list (with 0 or more elements of its own). Also, notice that some of the answer lists in this question have different types of elements. While this is legal in Python, you should avoid doing this.
