Question
--------

Which of the following are valid operations on points and vectors?  

### Answer

Adding a vector to a point to get a new point.  
Subtracting two points to get a vector.  

### Explanation

The primary operation we will use on vectors and points is to add a vector to a point to get a new point. This is how we will move objects on the canvas from one point to another. Note that if you can add a vector to a point to get another point, then if you subtract two points, you should get a vector. You should never add two points together, this results in a meaningless value.
