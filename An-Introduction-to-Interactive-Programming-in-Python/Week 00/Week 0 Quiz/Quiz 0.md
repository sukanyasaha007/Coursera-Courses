Question 04
-----------  
Which of the following arithmetic expressions are syntactically correct?  

### Answer and Explanation  
- `9 + * 4` : This example has incorrect syntax. The two operators + * together like this are meaningless.  
- `(8 + (1 + (2 * 4) - 3))` : This example has correct syntax.  
- `(7 - 2) / (3 ** 2)` : This example has correct syntax.  
- `5 * 3 (7 - 2)` : This example has incorrect syntax. This is missing an operator between 3 and (7-2).  
- `8 / -2` : This example has correct syntax. You can put a negative sign in front of a number like this.  
- `9 - (2 - (4 * 3)` : This example has incorrect syntax. This is missing closing parenthesis.  
- `5 - 1 - 3 - 7 - 0` : This example has correct syntax.  

Question 05
-----------  
You would like to make it so that the variable ounces has the value 16, thus representing one pound. What simple Python statement will accomplish this?  

### Answer and Explanation  
* `ounces = 16` : Correct  
* `ounces == 16` : Means something different  
* `16 = ounces` : Invalid syntax  
* `ounces := 16` : Invalid syntax  

Question 06
-----------

### Answer  
`mass_in_ounces / 0.035274`  

Question 07
-----------

### Answer and Explanation  
* `ounce(s)` : No, this is not a valid variable name. You cannot use parentheses in a variable name.  
* `16ounces` : No, this is not a valid variable name. A variable` name cannot begin with digits.  
* `number123` : This is a valid variable name.  
* `ounces` : This is a valid variable name.  
* `my_number` : This is a valid variable name., You can use underscores.  
* `__number__` : This is a valid variable name. However, convention says that Python variable names starting and ending with underscores only in special circumstances.  
* `MYnumber` : This is a valid variable name. However, convention says that Python variables shouldn't start with a capital letter.  
* `my-number` : No, this is not a valid variable name. You cannot use a dash in a variable name. The dash is interpreted as a minus sign.  

Question 08
-----------
