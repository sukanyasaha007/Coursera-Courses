Question 1
----------

Which of these expressions can be used to increment the value of a variable x by 1?

### Answer

x = x + 1  
x += 1  

### Explanation

Remember that the += operator retrieves the value of the variable on left-hand side of the assignment, adds the value of the expression on the right-hand side, and then stores the resulting sum back in the left-hand variable.
