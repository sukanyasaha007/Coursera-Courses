Quiz 3A
=======

Question 1
----------

What Python operator takes two strings (e.g., "sun" and "rise") and forms the combination of these two strings, one followed by the other (e.g., "sunrise")?  

### Answer

`+`  

Question 2
----------

What does the draw handler parameter represent?  
If you've forgotten, refer to the documentation.  

### Answer

The canvas  

Question 3
----------

What happens if you draw text outside the canvas coordinates?  

### Answer

Some or none of the text is shown. Conceptually, the text is drawn at whatever coordinates are given, but only whatever text fits within the canvas coordinates is shown.  

Question 4
----------

Assume we have a canvas that is 200 pixels wide and 300 pixels high. We want to draw a green line between the upper left corner and the lower right corner. Which of the following calls will accomplish this?  

### Answer

`canvas.draw_line((199, 299), (0, 0), 10, "Green")`  

### Explanation

A common mistake on this problem is to use a frame that is the same size as the default CodeSkuptor demo (300 pixels wide and 200 pixels high).  

Question 5
----------

Consider the following function definition.  
```  
def date(month, day):
    """
    Given numbers month and day, returns a string of the form '2/12',
    with the month followed by the day.
    """
    return month + "/" + day

print date(2, 12)
```  
This definition leads to an error. To fix it, what Python expression should replace the question marks below?  
```  
def date(month, day):
    """
    Given numbers month and day, returns a string of the form '2/12',
    with the month followed by the day.
    """
    return ???

print date(2, 12)
```  

### Answer

`str(month) + "/" + str(day)`  

Question 6
----------

Assume we have a variable `word` that contains a string, such as `"Mississippi"` or `"indivisible"`. We would like to determine how many `"i"`'s are in the string `word`. What code should replace the question marks in the following function definition?  
```  
def number_of_i(word):
    """Returns the number of lower-case i's in the word."""
    return ???
```  
There is a built-in function or method that will do this. Look in the CodeSkulptor documentation for the appropriate one.  

### Answer

`word.count("i")`  

Question 7
----------

Where should your `draw_text`, `draw_line`, and similar drawing calls be?  

### Answer

In a draw handler, or a helper function called from it.  

Question 8
----------

Which of the following function calls are valid, i.e., don't lead to an error?  

### Answer

* `int("5")`
* `float("5")`

Question 9
-----------

Turn the following description into a CodeSkulptor program, and run it.  
1. Create a 300-by-300 canvas.  
2. Draw two circles with radius 20 and white lines of width 10. One is centered at (90,200) and one at (210,200).  
3. Draw a red line of width 40 from (50,180) to (250,180).  
4. Draw two red lines of width 5 from (55,170) to (90,120) and from (90,120) to (130,120).  
5. Draw a red line of width 140 from (180,108) to (180,160).  

The resulting picture is a simple diagram of what?  

### Answer

An automobile  

Question 10
-----------  

The following is a diagram of an archery target.

To draw this in CodeSkulptor, we can put a small yellow circle with a black border on top of a slightly bigger yellow circle with a black border, . on top of a big white circle with a black border. In what order should your code draw these circles?  

### Answer  
Largest first  

### Explanation  
Whatever you draw last appears to be on top.
