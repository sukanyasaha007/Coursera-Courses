Question 1
----------
        
Which of the following can result in a NameError?

### Answer

Misspelled variable name
Misspelled function name
Missing import statement

### Explanation

Python doesn't check the spelling of a text string. However, disagreement between the definition and use of a variable or function name will cause a NameError. Failing to import a module will leave the functions in the module undefined and cause a NameError.

Which of the following can result in a AttributeError?

### Answer

Misspelled a constant or a call to a function in a module (the part after the period)

### Explanation

For example, misspelling a constant or a call to a function in random or math will cause an AttributeError.

Question 3

Which of the following can result in a AttributeError?

### Answer

Misspelled a constant or a call to a function in a module (the part after the period)

### Explanation

Question 4
----------

Which of the following is the result of evaluating "5 - 2"?

### Answer

"5 - 2"

### Explanation

Question 6
----------
